//! Named-color palette and severity helper for `Theme`.
//!
//! This module adds three new public types — [`NamedColor`], [`Palette`],
//! and [`Severity`] — plus three new methods on [`Theme`] (`color`,
//! `severity_color`, `severity_style`). Together they let consumers access
//! palette colors by name and bucket numeric values into a four-band
//! severity gradient without reaching for raw color constants.
//!
//! See the [theme module documentation](super) for an overview.

#[allow(unused_imports)]
// These imports are needed by subsequent tasks; removed when all types land.

#[allow(unused_imports)]

/// A four-band severity gradient for value-based coloring (good → mild → bad → critical).
///
/// `Severity` provides a unified vocabulary for "color this number by how bad it is" —
/// the most common visual primitive in monitoring, profiling, and status dashboards.
/// Pair with [`Severity::from_thresholds`] to bucket a numeric value, then pass to
/// [`Theme::severity_color`] or [`Theme::severity_style`] for theme-aware coloring.
///
/// `#[non_exhaustive]` so envision can add severity bands later without breaking
/// downstream `match` arms.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use envision::theme::{Severity, Theme};
///
/// let theme = Theme::catppuccin_mocha();
/// let ratio = 5.2;
/// let sev = Severity::from_thresholds(ratio, &[
///     (1.0,  Severity::Good),
///     (3.0,  Severity::Mild),
///     (10.0, Severity::Bad),
/// ]);
/// let style = theme.severity_style(sev);
/// // Use `style` in a Cell or StyledInline for value-coloring.
/// # let _ = style;
/// ```
